>[!NOTE]
> You don't need to follow the step from [ADMIRAL MIDNIGHT "III AM"](https://auttp.com/chatlogs/UTTPNETv3/knowledge-base.html), use step 4 instead.

4. Configure the script by running:
    ```bash
    node setup.js
    ```
    Follow the prompts to:
    * Set the desired reply text.
    * Choose whether to add random numbers to replies (recommended if you don't have a lot of brand accounts, this avoids spam filters).
    * Enter the YouTube video ID (the part after `watch?v=` in a youtube video URL).
    * Input cookies:
        * Open YouTube in your browser while logged into your **main** youtube account, click on your profile picture then switch channels if needed.
        * Open the developer tools (usually by pressing F12 or right-clicking and selecting "Inspect").
        * Go to the "Application" tab (might be under a ">>" icon).
        * Expand the "Cookies" section and select "youtube.com."
        * Search for and copy the values of these three cookies:
            * `__Secure-1PAPISID` (`SECURE_1PAPISID` in prompt)
            * `__Secure-1PSID` (`SECURE_1PSID` in prompt)
            * `__Secure-1PSIDTS` (`SECURE_1PSIDTS` in prompt, choose the second one if you see two)
       * **Important:** These cookies expire quickly. Obtain them quickly and close your browser after copying.
    * Set the minimum and maximum delay (in milliseconds) between replies.
    * Choose whether the script should loop indefinitely.
    * Enter the channel IDs of your brand accounts:
       * Navigate to a channel's "About" page (ends with a '>').
       * Click "Share channel" and choose "Copy channel ID."
       * Paste the copied ID into the setup script.
       * Repeat for each brand account you own.
    * Type "save" to finalize the configuration.

The script will automatically fetch comment IDs from the specified video and start replying to them using your configured settings.

### Common Errors

* **Error 403:** 
    * Possible causes:
        * Incorrect or expired cookies
        * Missing "Manager" permissions on the brand account, or an incorrect channel ID.
        * Rate limited
    * Solutions: 
        * Double-check your copied cookies and obtain fresh ones if needed.
        * Ensure your main account has "Manager" permissions for each brand account.
        * Verify the accuracy of the entered channel IDs.
        * Wait a few minutes and try again (or use VPN)
